PROBLEM (easy)
Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

Constraints:
0 <= n <= 105

Follow up:
It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?
Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?

/*
SOLUTION
create a vector to store results.
from i = 0 to n, for each value of i:
  keep dividing by 2 until that value of i = 0.
  keep track of how many times the remainder is 1.
  add the number of remainders to the results vector.
